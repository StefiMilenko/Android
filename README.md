# Android app with map
A simple Android app that uses osmdroid map to display and filter jobs on a map.
#Note: this app uses Firebase Realtime Database
Has login/register functionality, all users can create and place jobs on a map(if user location is enabled the job will be automatically placed on the user's location, otherwise they can click a location, get its coordinates, and then place a job there). Jobs can be filtered based on various values and can also be filtered by distance if the user location is enabled.
